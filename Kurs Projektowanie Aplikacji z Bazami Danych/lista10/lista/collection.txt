In NHibernate, collections are a way of representing relationships between entities. They can be used to handle
one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. They can contain almost any other NHibernate type, including basic
types, custom types, components, and references to other entities


W SQL Alchemy:

The relationship() function defines a linkage between two classes. When the linkage defines a one-to-many or many-to-many
 relationship, it’s represented as a Python collection when objects are loaded and manipulated.
